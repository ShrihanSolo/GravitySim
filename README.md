This was initially created as an extension project of the Berkeley CS 61B Gravity Simulation project - my first project run in Java. It uses tools from the Princeton StdDraw library, and a skeleton from the 61B.
  
## Running

Make sure you have an updated version of Java or a JDK runtime. You can run it by double clicking the .jar file or otherwise:

`java -jar NBodyExtreme.jar`

## Controls

Cursor+Click: Pause time and place a massive object.

Click Again: Resume time, and slingshot the planet!
